### A Markov chain to generate nietzsche-like text

All quotes are in the `nietzsche.csv` file and the tokens are in the json file,
to generate your own file run `node generate` and enter your csv name.

Run `node app` to generate continous quotes to look like a story, if you made
your own json, just enter your json file name otherwise leave it blank and press
`Enter`.
